/*Chapter 1: Tokens on Ethereum
Let's talk about tokens.
If you've been in the Ethereum space for any amount of time, you've probably heard people talking about tokens â€” specifically ERC20 tokens.
A token on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules â€” namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share, such as transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) and balanceOf(address _owner).
Internally the smart contract usually has a mapping, mapping(address => uint256) balances, that keeps track of how much balance each address has.
So basically a token is just a contract that keeps track of who owns how much of that token, and some functions so those users can transfer their tokens to other addresses.
Why does it matter?
Since all ERC20 tokens share the same set of functions with the same names, they can all be interacted with in the same ways.
This means if you build an application that is capable of interacting with one ERC20 token, it's also capable of interacting with any ERC20 token. That way more tokens can easily be added to your app in the future without needing to be custom coded. You could simply plug in the new token contract address, and boom, your app has another token it can use.
One example of this would be an exchange. When an exchange adds a new ERC20 token, really it just needs to add another smart contract it talks to. Users can tell that contract to send tokens to the exchange's wallet address, and the exchange can tell the contract to send the tokens back out to users when they request a withdraw.
The exchange only needs to implement this transfer logic once, then when it wants to add a new ERC20 token, it's simply a matter of adding the new contract address to its database.
Other token standards
ERC20 tokens are really cool for tokens that act like currencies. But they're not particularly useful for representing zombies in our zombie game.
For one, zombies aren't divisible like currencies â€” I can send you 0.237 ETH, but transfering you 0.237 of a zombie doesn't really make sense.

Secondly, all zombies are not created equal. Your Level 2 zombie "Steve" is totally not equal to my Level 732 zombie "H4XF13LD MORRIS ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯". (Not even close, Steve).

There's another token standard that's a much better fit for crypto-collectibles like CryptoZombies â€” and they're called ERC721 tokens.

ERC721 tokens are not interchangeable since each one is assumed to be unique, and are not divisible. You can only trade them in whole units, and each one has a unique ID. So these are a perfect fit for making our zombies tradeable.

Note that using a standard like ERC721 has the benefit that we don't have to implement the auction or escrow logic within our contract that determines how players can trade / sell our zombies. If we conform to the spec, someone else could build an exchange platform for crypto-tradable ERC721 assets, and our ERC721 zombies would be usable on that platform. So there are clear benefits to using a token standard instead of rolling your own trading logic.

Putting it to the Test
We're going to dive into the ERC721 implementation in the next chapter. But first, let's set up our file structure for this lesson.

We're going to store all the ERC721 logic in a contract called ZombieOwnership.

Declare our pragma version at the top of the file (check previous lessons' files for the syntax).

This file should import from zombieattack.sol.

Declare a new contract, ZombieOwnership, that inherits from ZombieAttack. Leave the body of the contract empty for now.

zombieownership.sol
zombieattack.sol
zombiehelper.sol
zombiefeeding.sol
zombiefactory.sol
ownable.sol

 Chapter 2: ERC721 Standard, Multiple Inheritance
Let's take a look at the ERC721 standard:

contract ERC721 {
  event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
  event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);

  function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
  function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
}
This is the list of methods we'll need to implement, which we'll be doing over the coming chapters in pieces.

It looks like a lot, but don't get overwhelmed! We're here to walk you through it.

Implementing a token contract
When implementing a token contract, the first thing we do is copy the interface to its own Solidity file and import it, import "./erc721.sol";. Then we have our contract inherit from it, and we override each method with a function definition.

But wait â€” ZombieOwnership is already inheriting from ZombieAttack â€” how can it also inherit from ERC721?

Luckily in Solidity, your contract can inherit from multiple contracts as follows:

contract SatoshiNakamoto is NickSzabo, HalFinney {
  // Omg, the secrets of the universe revealed!
}
As you can see, when using multiple inheritance, you just separate the multiple contracts you're inheriting from with a comma, ,. In this case, our contract is inheriting from NickSzabo and HalFinney.

Let's give it a try.

Putting it to the Test
We've already created erc721.sol with the interface above for you.

Import erc721.sol into zombieownership.sol

Declare that ZombieOwnership inherits from ZombieAttack AND ERC721

zombieownership.sol
zombieattack.sol
zombiehelper.sol
zombiefeeding.sol
zombiefactory.sol
ownable.sol
erc721.sol
12345678910
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./zombieattack.sol";
// Import file here

// Declare ERC721 inheritance here
contract ZombieOwnership is ZombieAttack {

}

Chapter 3: balanceOf & ownerOf
Great, let's dive into the ERC721 implementation!

We've gone ahead and copied the empty shell of all the functions you'll be implementing in this lesson.

In this chapter, we're going to implement the first two methods: balanceOf and ownerOf.

balanceOf
  function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 _balance);
This function simply takes an address, and returns how many tokens that address owns.

In our case, our "tokens" are Zombies. Do you remember where in our DApp we stored how many zombies an owner has?

ownerOf
  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);
This function takes a token ID (in our case, a Zombie ID), and returns the address of the person who owns it.

Again, this is very straightforward for us to implement, since we already have a mapping in our DApp that stores this information. We can implement this function in one line, just a return statement.

Note: Remember, uint256 is equivalent to uint. We've been using uint in our code up until now, but we're using uint256 here because we copy/pasted from the spec.

Putting it to the Test
I'll leave it to you to figure out how to implement these 2 functions.

Each function should simply be 1 line of code, a return statement. Take a look at our code from previous lessons to see where we're storing this data. If you can't figure it out, you can hit the "show me the answer" button for some help.

Implement balanceOf to return the number of zombies _owner has.

Implement ownerOf to return the address of whoever owns the zombie with ID _tokenId.
